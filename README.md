Programming Language: Python
Problem Description:
This project is a single Python program that solves three different problems using three separate functions.
The purpose of this lab is to practice conditional statements, loops, sorting algorithms, and searching algorithms without using built-in shortcuts.

Problems Overview:

Problem 1: Maximum of Three Numbers Takes three integer inputs. Finds the maximum value using only if–elif–else.
Built-in functions like max() are not used. If two or more numbers are equal, that value is considered the maximum.

Problem 2: Digit Count and Digit Sum Takes one integer input.Converts negative numbers into absolute value.
Calculates:Total number of digits Sum of digits Returns both values from the function.

Problem 3: Binary Search with Bubble Sort Takes a list of integers and a target value. Sorts the list using Bubble Sort (no sort() or sorted()).
Applies Binary Search on the sorted list.Returns:Index (0-based) if found -1 if not found

Concepts Used:
Python Functions
If–Elif–Else
Loops
Bubble Sort
Binary Search

How to Run the Program:
Open the Python file.Run the program using:clp_01.Py Enter inputs as instructed on the screen.

Output:
The program displays:The maximum of three numbers Digit count and digit sum Binary search 
result Output screenshots are included in the submitted CLP PDF file.
